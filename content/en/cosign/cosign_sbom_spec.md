`Cosign` supports working with SBOMs (Software Bill Of Materials). Both formats such as [SPDX](https://spdx.org), [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org) are supported.

The format for this is maintained within the `cosign` repo and available [here](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/SBOM_SPEC.md).
